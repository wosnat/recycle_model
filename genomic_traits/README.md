# Genomic traits

What are the genomic traits of the strains used in the experiment with emphasis on those correlating with the mechanisms tested in the models


The traits are taken from the paper:

 Zoccarato, L., Sher, D., Miki, T., Segr√®, D., & Grossart, H. P. (2022). 
 A comparative whole-genome approach identifies bacterial traits for marine microbial interactions. 
 Communications Biology, 5(1), 276.

The data in this folder was taken from the supp data and from the accompanying github repo:
